# BingoGame
This is a simple Bingo-Style-Game. 
Words falling from above, if you touch them, they get drawn in a table cell. 
If the word ist allready in a cell and another instance of the word touches the the ground, it gets deleted from the cell. 

After 30 Seconds the game ist over. 

It is a satirical game. The words are some BS, often heared from pro russian Partys in Germany. Like "But the USA!" or something like that. 
If you managed to fill all 9 cells, before the end of the countdown, you get a "Tankie-Diploma".
